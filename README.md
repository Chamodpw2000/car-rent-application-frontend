This is a Web Application for a car renting service. Through this project, I'm focusing on gaining hands-on experience with Spring Security along with JSON Web Tokens to secure the web application using role-based access control for admins and normal users. This application allows users to create their accounts and rent cars based on the current availability of cars they like, while admins can add cars to the web application and manage users.
